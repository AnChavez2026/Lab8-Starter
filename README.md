### Question on graceful degradation and service workers

Graceful degradation focuses on ensuring the core features of an application are functional across all platforms, providing fallbacks for features that may not run on certain web browsers. Service workers are related to this concept as they offer a solution for maintaining usability when the network is unavailable. By caching content, service workers enable the website to still load essential elements, ensuring a usable experience even without a network connection. Thus, both graceful degradation and service workers work together to maintain a functional and accessible user experience under varying conditions.
